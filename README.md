# Neural Network Visualizer

A visualizer of the various layers of a neural network to understand their working better. I've used the MNIST dataset.

## Installation

Clone the repo in your local directory. Run ml_server.py first and then run app.py using the following code

```python
streamlit run app.py
```

## Usage

On the streamlit application, click on the button to visualize the layers of the neural network. You can see the test image by clicking on the sidebar and verify the results.
Feel free to edit the .ipynb file and add more layers to the model and visualise them. Make sure to save the model and add the necessary code for that layer in the app.py file.
